This program allows the player as a Beta (default unit type) to control a bunch
 of Novas (level 1 ground units).
The Novas will boost (fly) and follow the player if they are too far (more than
 30 blocks distance). When the player clicks a location, the Novas will approach
 that location and shoot there as soon as they are in range. If they are already
 in range they will only attack, but if they are in the range of a dangerous
 tower (towers that attack ground targets) they will shoot from as far away as
 possible, so you can attack a tower while making sure the Novas don't go under
 fire.

Can be turned on/off using a switch nearby.
Logic processor is recommended.

To start, place a switch near the processor and link it as switch1 and turn it on.
